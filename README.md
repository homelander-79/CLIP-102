# CLIP-102 

A collection of fine-tuned [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) models on the IP102 dataset for insect pest classification. This project explores multiple tuning strategies to adapt CLIP for fine-grained agricultural image recognition.

## 📌 Overview

- 🔍 Dataset: [IP102](https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102) – a large-scale dataset of 102 insect pest classes.
- 🎯 Goal: Improve CLIP's performance on fine-grained pest classification through domain-specific fine-tuning.
- 🛠️ Methods: Various fine-tuning techniques were applied and compared, including:
  - Linear probing
  - Full model fine-tuning
  - Prompt tuning
  - Adapter tuning
